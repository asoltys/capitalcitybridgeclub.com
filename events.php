      <h1>SPECIAL EVENTS</h1>
				<hr />
					
        <p>
        We held a very successful, fun, Bridge Bowl last year, and have been repeatedly asked to repeat this event, so...
        </p>

        <p>
        YOU ARE INVITED TO OUR SECOND ANNUAL "BRIDGE BOWL"<br />
        an afternoon of fun Bridge and Bowls where teams of four compete in a combined event.
        </p>

        <p>
        First your team of four will play a Round-Robin of Lawn Bowls comprising four two-end games.<br />
        Next, refreshment break (price of refreshments included in entry fee)<br />
        Finally, 16 hands of Bridge in a team format.<br />
        The placings for the Bowls Tournament and Bridge Tournament will be combined to produce an overall winning team.
        </p>

        <p>
        A cup will be awarded to the winners<br />
        Money prizes to two top teams<br />
        Lots of door prizes<br />
        Lots of fun
        </p>

        <p>
        Entry fee $80 per team of 4
        </p>

        <p>
        Players from both the Lawn Bowling and Bridge Club will be on hand to explain rules. Equipment will be supplied, just wear flat rubber soled shoes.
        </p>

        <p>
